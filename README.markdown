A [giter8][g8] template for creating programs that use [conscript][cs].

    $ g8 n8han/conscript
    # answer questions
    $ cd my-app
    $ sbt
    > update
    > cs-run app

For your program to be useful to others, it will need to be published
to a repository. The procedure above is for testing it locally.
